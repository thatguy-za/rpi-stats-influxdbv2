# A lightweight way to monitor system statistics in InfluxDB

Inspired by [this guide](https://simonhearne.com/2020/pi-metrics-influx/), I cobbled together this script to send system stats to InfluxDB 2.0 for a Pi that's running as my off site backup server. More info about that project (with 3D printed case) in [this article](https://tristam.ie/2023/140/). While this is aimed at Raspberry Pi based systems, it should work on any other machine that runs a Debian based operating system.

For more info, please check out [my article about this](https://tristam.ie/2023/28/).
