# A lightweight way to monitor system statistics in InfluxDB

Inspired by [this guide](https://simonhearne.com/2020/pi-metrics-influx/), I wrote this script to send Raspberry Pi system stats to Influxdb 2.0. While this is aimed at Raspberry Pi based systems, it should work on any other machine that runs a debian distro.
